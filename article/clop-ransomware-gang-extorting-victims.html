                Clop ransomware gang begins extorting GoAnywhere zero-day victims.
            </h2>
            <h3>Author: Lawrence Abrams</h3>
            <p>
                The Clop ransomware gang has begun extorting companies whose data was stolen using a zero-day vulnerability in the Fortra GoAnywhere MFT secure file-sharing solution.<br>

                In February, the GoAnywhere MFT file transfer solution developers warned customers that a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability was being exploited on exposed administrative consoles.<br><br>

                GoAnywhere is a secure web file transfer solution that allows companies to securely transfer encrypted files with their partners while keeping detailed audit logs of who accessed the files.<br>
                While no details were publicly shared on how the vulnerability was exploited, a proof-of-concept exploit was soon released, followed by a patch for the flaw.<br><br>

                The extortion group said they used the flaw over ten days to steal data from 130 companies. At the time, BleepingComputer could not independently confirm these claims, and Fortra did not respond to our emails.<br>
                Since then, two companies, Community Health Systems (CHS) and Hatch Bank, disclosed that data was stolen in the GoAnywhere MFT attacks.

            <h3>Clop begins extorting GoAnywhere customers</h3>
            <p>
                Last night, the Clop ransomware gang began publicly exploiting victims of the GoAnywhere attacks by adding seven new companies to their data leak site.

Only one of the victims, Hatch Bank, is publicly known to have been breached using the vulnerability.<br> However, BleepingComputer has learned that at least two other listed companies had their data stolen using this flaw as well.

The entries on the data leak site all state that the release of data is "coming soon" but include screenshots of allegedly stolen data.<br><br>
